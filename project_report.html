							<h2><a href="#">Problem Statement</a></h2>							
							<p>
								The main issue with your organization is that your publicity is very low, which you can improve drastically 
								to reach your target audience. With only around 600 followers on Instagram there isn’t a large audience for 
								what is trying to be spread. Your target audience should include the people you are trying to have in your 
								system as well as those already in it. These are people in poverty and low income status in Northwest Indiana. 
								Also, you are missing out on trying to maximize your mission and goals which states, 
								“Community Healthcare System is committed to provide the highest quality care in the most cost-efficient manner, 
								respecting the dignity of the individual, providing for the well being of the community and serving the needs 
								of all people, including the poor and disadvantaged” (Community Foundation of NWI). 
								As you state with your mission, you need to be trying to reach out to the poor, and people who do not have healthcare. 
								We will need to get the 600 followers up to the thousands to help build your community to be  more successful. 
							</p>
							<h2><a href="#">Research Discussion</a></h2>							
							<p>
								In our research, we have found that the poverty rate in NWI is 15.8 percent of the population which equates to 
								about 79,000 people in NWI. We also found out that the percentage of preventable deaths were higher in rural areas, 
								and by having access to primary care nearly 130,000 deaths that could be prevented in the U.S. They also state that 
								there were 541,905 people who were not insured, and with our main issue focusing on people who can not afford health 
								care this is a major cause for concern. This is a big deal because many people can not afford those costs that come 
								before insurance comes into play. With this many people in Indiana alone who do not have health care, it is very important 
								for your Foundation to reach out to these people to help them in any way possible. We have come up with ways to help 
								you get those followers up and reach all the potential people in need. 
							</p>
							<h2><a href="#">Deliverable & Solution</a></h2>							
							<p>
								We have come up with a way to help your organization build its follower base by creating various Instagram posts for you. 
								These posts through Instagram and other social media platforms will help you reach your target audience as well as many 
								others in the community. You should try to be posting at least once a day to help grow your platform, and to seem active. 
								You will also need to be responsive to people in the comment section to help people who have questions or concerns. 
								There is also a button through Instagram to help link the same post to the other mentioned social media platforms. 
								This will make it very easy for the person who normally runs these accounts to manage and stay on top of the publicity.
							</p>
							<h2><a href="#">Recommendations</a></h2>
							<p>
								Overall, your organization is very well put together. There are just a few touch ups that are needed to help your 
								organization grow and help reach the target audience. By listening to us and community feedback, as well as using 
								social media to help reach your audience, you will be very successful in growing your foundation all throughout NWI. 
								We recommend implementing these posts and changes as soon as you can, and we also recommend having a full time social 
								media manager to help manage all of the accounts throughout the day so the account is always active and growing.
