								<h2>Mission</h2>							
							<p>
								The Community Healthcare System is committed to provide the highest quality care in the most cost-efficient manner, 
								respecting the dignity of the individual, providing for the well being of the community and serving the needs 
								of all people, including the poor and disadvantaged. 
							</p>
							<h2>Vision</h2>							
							<p>
								Community Healthcare System is one medical provider organized across four hospital campuses. It links four Indiana 
								hospitals - Community Hospital in Munster; St. Catherine Hospital in East Chicago; St. Mary Medical Center in Hobart; 
								and Community Stroke & Rehabilitation Center in Crown Point - and many outpatient clinics and physician offices. The 
								system is dedicated to maintain the Catholic tradition of St. Catherine Hospital and St. Mary Medical Center as well 
								as the non-sectarian foundation of Community Hospital. Community Healthcare System will become the prominent, integrated 
								healthcare system in Northwest Indiana. Through integration, the system will capitalize on opportunities to increase overall 
								growth, improve operating efficiency, and realize capital to better serve our patients, physicians, and employees.
							</p>
							<h2>Values</h2>	
							<h3>Dignity</h3>
							<p>
								We value the dignity of human life, which is sacred and deserving of respect and fairness throughout its stages of existence.
							</p>
							<h3>Compassionate Care</h3>
							<p>
								We value compassionate care, treating those we serve and one another with professionalism, concern and kindness, exceeding expectations.
							</p>
							<h3>Community</h3>
							<p>
								We value meeting the vital responsibilities in the community we serve, and take a leadership role in enhancing the quality of life and health, striving to reduce the incidence of illness through clinical services, education and prevention.
							</p>
							<h3>Quality</h3>
							<p>
								We value quality and strive for excellence in all we do, working together collaboratively as the power of our combined efforts exceeds what each of us can accomplish alone.
							</p>
							<h3>Stewardship</h3>
							<p>
								We value trustworthy stewardship and adherence to the highest ethical standards that justify public trust and protect what is of value to the system - its human resources, material and financial assets.
