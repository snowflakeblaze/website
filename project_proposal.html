								<p>
									Tyler Nelson, Pritesh Soma, Jarek Rossi, and Jaylin Powell. Our foundation is the Community Foundation of NWI. They are a non profit organization that tries to help the poor who can not afford health care costs in Northwest Indiana. We chose this issue because a ton of people are overwhelmed with the cost of medical bills and we wanted to try to find an organization that deals with this issue. We found the Community Foundation of NWI which they try to help with that issue. We are now trying to help them out on what they can improve on.

								<h3>What is the problem your group is trying to solve for your organization? </h3>
							</header>
							<section>
								
								<p>
									They are dealing with the Finances & Approaching the publicity. They need more help gaining donations as inflation rises and so do the medical bills for people. The company also suffers from low publicity and by improving their publicity it can help them reach more people for donations. 
								</p>								
							</section>
							<header>
								<h3>Who is your audience? </h3>
							</header>
							<section>								
								<p>
									Lower income individuals, in NWI. The reason for that is because many lower income families are trying to worry about putting food on the table and not their medical bills.  
								</p>								
							</section>												
							<header>
								<h3>What is the solution your group has determined and how will your deliverable achieve that solution? </h3>
							</header>
							<section>								
								<p>
									Create more publicity by improving their social media as it is very inactive and not much effort is put into it. This will also help bring in more donations for the organization to help with the finance side of things. 
								</p>								
							</section><header>
								<h3>How/where will your deliverable reach/be distributed to your audience? </h3>
							</header>
							<section>								
								<p>
									Creating advertisements on social media through posts on apps such as instagram, facebook and many other platforms. We will try to have certain hashtags in our posts so it can reach certain audiences that we are trying to reach. 
								</p>								
							</section>
							<header>
								<h3>How will your writing and images used in your deliverable employ ethos, pathos, logos?</h3>
							</header>
							<section>								
								<p>
									We will create images through social media and it will have emotion shown through the image to help promote donations. This will allow the Foundation to raise money to help other hospitals and patients. We will also use our posts to reach logos by including many facts and that will allow people to try and help and also come to more free screenings to learn more about what is going on. 
								</p>								
							</section>

								<h3>What information will you include so your audience can respond in the way you intend? </h3>
							</header>
							<section>								
								<p>
									What is the call to action and where will that appear on your deliverable? We will include information such as how many lower income individuals there are in NWI who struggle with health care costs and create a post allowing people to donate and help out.
