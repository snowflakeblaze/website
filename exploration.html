									This article highlights the issues with healthcare in rural areas in the U.S.. It starts by going over the various 
									benefits that having primary care offers such as lower cancer death rates, lower heart disease, and lower risk of 
									strokes. It also states that the percentage of preventable deaths were higher in rural areas and by having access 
									to primary care nearly 130,000 deaths could be prevented in the U.S.. After going over the various causes for the 
									differences between rural and urban healthcare, they begin to go over all the things that could be done to help 
									alleviate or fix the problems. This article can be applied to many residents of Northwest Indiana because many 
									towns even 30 minutes south are struggling with these issues. By understanding what can be done to help, we can 
									use this information to give the organization ideas on how to help the lower income communities of Northwest Indiana.

									This website allows you to narrow down the facts based on your county. These important facts include poverty rates, 
									population, education, health, and many more. You can also compare the data to other data from other nearby counties 
									to see how Lake County is doing vs others. With the use of all these facts, we can use it to determine the poverty rate 
									and that 15.8 percent of almost 500,000 people. There is another section where it tells us that there are 8.1 percent of 
									people under the age of 65 who do not have health insurance. With this data we will use it to show how important it is 
									for us to reach out to the people who are in poverty that need help with health care costs. We also pinpoint those people 
									who do not have healthcare under 65 as well to try and get them to come to NWI Community Foundation for help.

									This article shows how non profit organizations can maximize their business using instagram. “Nonprofits can leverage 
									Instagram to share their mission, advocate for support, solicit donations, and show impact using one of the most visceral 
									and powerful mediums possible: visual media. Between 2020 and 2021, over half of donors (55%) said they were as likely or 
									more likely to learn about new causes and donate to their campaigns through social media compared to other mediums. With 
									that in mind, nonprofits must prioritize their social presence in 2022 and beyond.” These facts help show how useful 
									instagram is in 2022 for non profit organizations such as our Community Foundation. The article also goes through and 
									shows how to build your social media account and make it useful for our foundation.That includes setting up the account 
									all the way to posting it. We will use this information to help rebuild NWI Community Foundation’s instagram account they 
									have already to help have more publicity for more growth and awareness we are trying to promote.

									In the article it focuses on the state of Indiana, specifically on healthcare. They state that there were 541,905 people 
									who were not insured. With our main issue focusing on people who can not afford health care. This is a big deal because 
									many people can not afford those costs that come before insurance comes into play. With this many people in Indiana alone 
									who do not have health care, it is very important as to our Foundation to reach these people to help them in any way possible.

									This article informs you about all the different problems and issues we have within the healthcare industry. It starts off 
									by talking about the lack of insurance the people in the United States have. It goes into depth about how lack of health 
									insurance has deadly consequences because they are less likely to receive preventive health care  and care for various 
									conditions and illnesses. For example this article also talks about the problem we have with high cost of healthcare.
									The United States spends much more money per capita on health care than any other industrial nation. This article  informs 
									you about why the United States insurance is so high. One reason is that “so much of US health insurance is private, billing 
									and record-keeping tasks are immense, and “hordes of clerks and accountants [are] needed to deal with insurance paperwork,” 
									according to one observer (Boffey, 2012, p. SR12)”
